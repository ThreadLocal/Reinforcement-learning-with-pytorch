This repository will implement the classic and state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithms(e.g., DQN, Actor-Critic, DDPG). The aim of this repository is to provide clear pytorch code for people to learn the deep reinforcement learning algorithm. 

## Requirements
- python <=3.6 
- tensorboardX
- gym >= 0.10
- pytorch >= 0.4
